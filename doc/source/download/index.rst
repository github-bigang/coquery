Download
========

Coquery can be installed in two ways: as a binary package, or as a 
source code package. 

Binary installer (Windows only)
-------------------------------

The binary package installs all files on your computer required to run 
Coquery. Currently, it is currently only available on Windows.

After installing, start Coquery from the Windows application menu.

Source code package (Windows, Linux, and Mac OS |nbsp| X)
---------------------------------------------------------

In order to run Coquery from a source code package, a Python interpreter has 
to be available on your system. Most Linux and Mac OS |nbsp| X systems provide
a Python interpreter by default. Windows users can download and install a 
free Python distribution, for example Anaconda (|anaconda|).

To install the source code package, you can use the Python package installer 
``pip``, which will also install required packages if they are not present 
on your system. Start a command-line interface (``cmd.exe`` on Windows), and 
type the following command::
    
    pip install coquery

After installing, start Coquery by typing ``coquery`` at the command line.
